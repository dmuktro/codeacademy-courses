ENVIRONMENT
PATH
What happens when you type this command?

$ echo $PATH

/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin
PATH is an environment variable that stores a list of directories separated by a colon. Looking carefully, echo $PATH lists the following directories:

/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/bin
Each directory contains scripts for the command line to execute. The PATH variable simply lists which directories contain scripts.

For example, many commands we've learned are scripts stored in the /bin directory.

/bin/pwd
This is the script that is executed when you type the pwd command.

/bin/ls
This is the script that is executed when you type the ls command.

In advanced cases, you can customize the PATH variable when adding scripts of your own.
Instructions
1.
In the command line type

env
2.
Then type

env | grep PATH
(Tip: If you are unable to type |, you can find help here.)

ENVIRONMENT
env
What happens when you type this command?
The env command stands for "environment", and returns a list of the environment variables for the current user. 
Here, the env command returns a number of variables, including PATH, PWD, PS1, and HOME.

env | grep PATH
env | grep PATH is a command that displays the value of a single environment variable. 
Here the standard output of env is "piped" to the grep command. 
grep searches for the value of the variable PATH and outputs it to the terminal.

/*
ENVIRONMENT
Generalizations
Congratulations! You learned to use the bash profile to configure the environment. What can we generalize so far?

The environment refers to the preferences and settings of the current user.
The nano editor is a command line text editor used to configure the environment.
~/.bash_profile is where environment settings are stored. You can edit this file with nano.
environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.

export VARIABLE="Value" sets and exports an environment variable.
USER is the name of the current user.
PS1 is the command prompt.
HOME is the home directory. It is usually not customized.
PATH returns a colon separated list of file paths. It is customized in advanced cases.
env returns a list of environment variables.
