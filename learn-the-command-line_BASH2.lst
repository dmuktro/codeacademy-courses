cp II

	cp biopic/cleopatra.txt historical/

To copy a file into a directory, use cp with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument. Here, we copy the file biopic/cleopatra.txt and place it in the historical/ directory.
	cp biopic/ray.txt biopic/notorious.txt historical/

To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory as the last argument. Here, we copy the files biopic/ray.txt and biopic/notorious.txt into the historical/ directory.

1.
Let's look at two more ways to use cp.
Navigate to the comedy/ directory.
	cd ../../comedy

2.
In this directory, create a new file named shrek.txt. (Here's a hint on how to do this.)

3.
Then type
	cp * satire/

4.
Navigate to the satire/ directory.
List all files and directories in the working directory.
You should see a copy of the files the-office.txt and shrek.txt in this directory. We'll explain how this works in the next exercise.

5.
Here's another way to use cp.
Navigate to the action/ directory. Type
	cd ../../action/
Here we navigate up two directories, and then into the action/ directory.

6.
Type
	cp m*.txt scifi/

7.
Change directories into scifi/.
List all files and directories in the working directory.
You should see a copy of all text files starting with "m": matrix.txt, matrix-reloaded.txt, and matrix-revolutions.txt.

*/
MANIPULATION
Wildcards
cp * satire/
In addition to using filenames as arguments, we can use special characters like * to select groups of files. These special characters are called wildcards. The * selects all files in the working directory, so here we use cp to copy all files into the satire/ directory.

cp m*.txt scifi/
Here, m*.txt selects all files in the working directory starting with "m" and ending with ".txt", and copies them to scifi/.
1.
In addition to copying files, we can move files from the command line.
Change directories into the action/ directory.

cd ../
2.
Type

mv superman.txt superhero/
3.
Navigate to the superhero/ directory.
List all files and directories in the working directory. You should see superman.txt in it.
4.
Here's another way to use mv.
Navigate up one directory from action/superhero/ to action/.
5.
Then type

mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
6.
Navigate to superhero/ again.
List all files and directories in the working directory. You should see wonderwoman.txt and batman.txt in it.
7.
Here's one more way to use mv.
Type

mv batman.txt spiderman.txt
8.
List all files and directories in the working directory. You should see the file batman.txt has been renamed as spiderman.txt.

/* 8of10
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/manipulation/exercises/mv?action=lesson_resume
*/
mv
The mv command moves files. It's similar to cp in its usage.

mv superman.txt superhero/
To move a file into a directory, use mv with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument. Here we move superman.txt into superhero/.

mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
To move multiple files into a directory, use mv with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory as the last argument. Here, we move wonderwoman.txt and batman.txt into superhero/.

mv batman.txt spiderman.txt
To rename a file, use mv with the old file as the first argument and the new file as the second argument. By moving batman.txt into spiderman.txt, we rename the file as spiderman.txt.
1.
Change directory to comedy/slapstick.
List all files and directories in the working directory.

cd ../../comedy/slapstick/
2.
Type

rm waterboy.txt
3.
List all files and directories in the working directory. You should see that waterboy.txt has been removed.
4.
Navigate up one directory from comedy/slapstick/ to comedy/.
5.
Type

rm -r slapstick
6.
List all files and directories in the working directory. You should see that the slapstick/ directory has been removed.

/* 9of10
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/manipulation/exercises/rm?action=lesson_resume
*/
MANIPULATION
rm
rm waterboy.txt
The rm command deletes files and directories. Here we remove the file waterboy.txt from the filesystem.

rm -r comedy
The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The -r stands for "recursive," and it's used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.

Be careful when you use rm! It deletes files and directories permanently. There isn't an undelete command, so once you delete a file or directory with rm, it's gone.
Instructions
The commands we've covered so far are commonly used to view and change the filesystem.

Let's summarize what we've done so far. Click Next to continue.

MANIPULATION
Generalizations
Congratulations! You learned how to use the command line to view and manipulate the filesystem. What can we generalize so far?
	Options modify the behavior of commands:
ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt
From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories
Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories

$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc
| is a "pipe". The | takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right. You can think of this as "command to command" redirection.

Here the output of cat volcanoes.txt is the standard input of wc. in turn, the wc command outputs the number of lines, words, and characters in volcanoes.txt, respectively.

$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt
Multiple |s can be chained together. Here the standard output of cat volcanoes.txt is "piped" to the wc command. The standard output of wc is then "piped" to cat. Finally, the standard output of cat is redirected to islands.txt.

You can view the output data of this chain by typing cat islands.txt.
1.
A few commands are particularly powerful when combined with redirection. Let's try them out.

First, use cat to output the contents of lakes.txt.
2.
We'll begin with sort. In the terminal type

sort lakes.txt
3.
Then type

cat lakes.txt | sort > sorted-lakes.txt
4.
Use cat to output the contents of sorted-lakes.txt.

sort
$ sort lakes.txt
sort takes the standard input and orders it alphabetically for the standard output. Here, the lakes in sort lakes.txt are listed in alphabetical order.

$ cat lakes.txt | sort > sorted-lakes.txt
Here, the command takes the standard output from cat lakes.txt and "pipes" it to sort. The standard output of sort is redirected to sorted-lakes.txt.

You can view the output data by typing cat on the file sorted-lakes.txt.

Then type

grep -i Mount mountains.txt

REDIRECTION
grep I
$ grep Mount mountains.txt
grep stands for "global regular expression print". It searches files for lines that match a pattern and returns the results. It is also case sensitive. Here, grep searches for "Mount" in mountains.txt.

$ grep -i Mount mountains.txt
grep -i enables the command to be case insensitive. Here, grep searches for capital or lowercase strings that match Mount in mountains.txt.

The above commands are a great way to get started with grep. If you are familiar with regular expressions, you can use regular expressions to search for patterns in files.

sed
$ sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt
sed stands for "stream editor". It accepts standard input and modifies it based on an expression, before displaying it as output data. It is similar to "find and replace".

Let's look at the expression 's/snow/rain/':

s: stands for "substitution". it is always used when using sed for substitution.
snow: the search string, the text to find.
rain: the replacement string, the text to add in place.
In this case, sed searches forests.txt for the word "snow" and replaces it with "rain." Importantly, the above command will only replace the first instance of "snow" on a line.

$ sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt
The above command uses the g expression, meaning "global". Here sed searches forests.txt for the word "snow" and replaces it with "rain", globally. All instances of "snow" on a line will be turned to "rain".

Generalizations
Congratulations! You learned how to use the command line to redirect standard input and standard output. What can we generalize so far?

Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error.
The common redirection commands are:

> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< redirects standard input to a command.
| redirects standard output of a command to another command.
A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
