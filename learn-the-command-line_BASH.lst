1.
To access the command line, we use a terminal emulator, often just called the terminal.

In the terminal, after the $ type:

ls
and press Enter. Be sure to type the letter l as in "lemon" and not the number 1.

You should see three items print out below the command. Click Next to learn how this command works.

ls
What's going on here?

$ ls                                                                                                                     
2014  2015  hardware.txt
In the terminal, first you see $. This is called a shell prompt. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command.
When you type ls, the command line looks at the folder you are in, and then "lists" the files and folders inside it. The directories 2014, 2015, and the file hardware.txt are the contents of the current directory.
ls is an example of a command, a directive to the computer to perform a specific task.
Instructions
When using the command line, we refer to folders as directories. Files and directories on your computer are organized into a filesystem.

Click Next to find out how the filesystem works.

Filesystem
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure:

The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files. Here blog/ is the parent of 2014/, 2015/, and hardware.txt.
Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.
You're probably already familiar with this tree structure - Mac Finder and Windows Explorer represent the filesystem as trees as well.

At any point, you can reference the filesystem for this lesson here.

Let's see how to navigate the filesystem from the command line. In the terminal, after the shell prompt, type

pwd
and press Enter. We'll explain this in the next exercise.

cd I
$ cd 2015
cd stands for "change directory". Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, cd switches you into the directory you specify. In other words, cd changes the working directory.
The directory we change into is 2015. When a file, directory or program is passed into a command, it is called an argument. Here the 2015 directory is an argument for the cd command.
The cd command takes a directory name as an argument, and switches into that directory.
1.
Then type

cd jan/memory/
Print the working directory to see the new location.
2.
Then type

cd ..
Print the working directory again to see the new location.

NAVIGATION
cd II
$ cd jan/memory
To navigate directly to a directory, use cd with the directory's path as an argument. Here, cd jan/memory/ command navigates directly to the jan/memory directory.

$ cd ..
To move up one directory, use cd ... Here, cd .. navigates up from jan/memory/ to jan/.
1.
Change the directory to the 2015/feb/ directory

cd ../feb
List all files and directories in the working directory.
2.
Type

mkdir media
Again, list all files and directories in the working directory. You'll see that there is now a new directory named media/.

--part7of9
NAVIGATION
mkdir
$ mkdir media
The mkdir command stands for "make directory". It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.

Here we used mkdir to create a new directory named media/ inside the feb/ directory.
1.
Navigate to the 2014/dec/ directory.

cd ../../2014/dec
List all files and directories in the working directory.
2.
Then type

touch keyboard.txt
Again, list all files and directories in the working directory. You'll see that there is now a new file named keyboard.txt.

--part8of9
NAVIGATION
touch
touch keyboard.txt
The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.

Here we used touch to create a new file named keyboard.txt inside the 2014/dec/ directory.
Instructions
The commands we've covered so far are commonly used to navigate the filesystem. There are more commands you can use to master the command line, and we'll cover them in the next lessons.

Let's summarize what we've done so far.

Generalizations
Congratulations! You've learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:
pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.
ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.
cd switches you into the directory you specify.
mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.
touch creates a new file inside the working directory.
